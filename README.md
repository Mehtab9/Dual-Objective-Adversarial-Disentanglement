# Dual-Objective-Adversarial-Disentanglement


## Abstract
Recently, the challenge of protecting privacy-sensitive information in speech data has received growing attention. While many studies have explored the protection of speaker identity, the protection of individual speaker attributes, such as gender, has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we propose a dual-objective approach to adversarial disentanglement that protects the gender attribute of the speaker in speech data used for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The approach combines an adversarial Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) objective with a utility objective. Experiments on the PC-GITA and NeuroVoz PD speech datasets show that our approach can block the ability of a classifier to infer the gender of the speaker, while preserving the utility for diagnostic purposes. Our work contributes to speech privacy, but also to the understanding of gender for PD diagnosis.
